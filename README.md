# Computing-Intelligence-Course
Computing intelligence lectures and demonstrations using Python. These lectures introduce some well-known intelligent computing issues on artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and evolutionary computing, which are in the computing intelligence course given at BUAA.

To open these notebooks, [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), a web application used to create as well as share documents where live code, 
numerical visualization, simulation animation and explanatory text can be organized and presented in an interactive manner, is recommended.
