# Computing-Intelligence-Course
Computing intelligence lectures and demonstrations using Python. These lectures introduce some well-known intelligent computing issues on artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and evolutionary computing, which are in the computing intelligence course given by Beihang University.

To open these notebooks, [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), a web application used to create as well as share documents where live code, 
numerical visualization, simulation animation and explanatory text can be organized and presented in an interactive manner, is recommended. 

Please feel free to use and modify these notebooks, and don't hesitate in contacting me, if you have any questions. Thank you!
